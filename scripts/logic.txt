We need to implement logic to count footfall for a given video clip.

Simple Logic:
- Check for track ID of an object and increment whenever the object crosses the designated area(green area) *FROM ABOVE* (Ensure only movement towards the area from top to bottom is considered)

Edge Case:
-Ignore objects re-entering area (Need to increment as the object is coming in frame of reference with a new ID)
